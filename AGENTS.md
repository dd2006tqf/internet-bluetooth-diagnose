Start every implementation or evaluation session with:

1. `scripts/resume_from_snapshot.sh`
2. the active change's proposal, design, delta specs and tasks
3. the relevant role prompt under `prompts/`

OpenSpec artifacts own intent; change-local `harness/` owns execution evidence. The root snapshot selects one active change but never replaces CLI status or task instructions. Multiple unarchived changes are allowed; never guess an active change.

Generator must preserve role separation, reuse existing code, stay inside the approved Implementation Economy budget and run commands through `task_verify.sh`. For an integrated change it binds each closing command to the exact approved surface and evidence role; an unplanned product surface returns to Planner before implementation continues. Evaluator must begin an attempt, read the complete candidate report, independently execute every relevant build/test/behavior command through `evaluator_check.sh --run` with the corresponding surface/role bindings, copy the machine-written ledger entries into the closed `evaluation.json`, then finish the attempt. A `Pass` must be fresh, traceable, have no orphan surface or candidate, and be free of blocking untested behavior.

Stable project operations are selected by command ID and executed through the evidence wrappers' `--project-command <command-id>` option; the wrappers normalize that selection to `scripts/project_command.sh <command-id> --change <active-change> --json` only after resolving the active change. Neither role may replace a reviewed Profile command with an ad-hoc shell string. Change-specific evidence wrappers remain responsible for binding that execution to a requirement, task, surface and verdict.

Planner investigates the current project before proposing a design, compares only real alternatives and records TDD applicability or an approved exception. Generator follows RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR -> REGRESSION for behavior changes and uses systematic RCA for unexpected failures. Evaluator reviews specification compliance first and code quality second inside the same Evaluation attempt; it never creates a second verdict.

Classify verification assets by lifetime. Tests and fixtures that prevent future regressions or intentionally demonstrate a supported consumer stay in project `tests/`/`examples/` and are reviewed like any other project code. A one-off probe, temporary downstream consumer, generated source, executable or output belongs only in the Harness local verification workspace. A closing command may use it only through a durable driver that recreates the experiment from an empty workspace; temporary paths are never producer/consumer paths, focused RED test paths or archived evidence.

For each change, Planner records one closed `Integration Completeness v1` block in `design.md`: use an explicitly reviewed empty `surfaces` array only when the change has no product surface; otherwise enumerate producer paths, real consumer paths/entrypoint, exact requirement references, task IDs, Verify kinds, evidence roles, expected observable result and one exact argv/exit/output-marker probe per kind-role pair. A `build_or_install` surface must additionally declare the boolean `runnable_artifact`; when true, its exact probe matrix includes executable test/behavior evidence in addition to downstream build evidence. Run `integration_surface_check.sh --plan-check` before freezing planning. The generated report is derived evidence, never a second planning source.

Use fresh context selectively for high-risk work or independent review. In one worktree there is only one writer. A read-only Subagent must not switch the active change, modify planning or evidence, check tasks, write Evaluation or archive. Worktree creation and every Git integration/cleanup action remain user-owned and are never automated by this Harness.

Do not call global `openspec`, `/opsx` commands, `@latest`, sync, bulk archive, `--skip-specs` or `--no-validate`. Use the repository wrappers.

An existing OpenSpec change without AutoAI evidence must be attached through `scripts/change_adopt.sh`; never create or overwrite its `harness/` directory by hand. A partial archive failure blocks all managed work until `scripts/archive_recover.sh` verifies an unambiguous state, strictly validates main specs and records an explicit acknowledgment.
